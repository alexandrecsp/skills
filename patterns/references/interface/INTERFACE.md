# Interface Design

## Overview

Design stable, well-documented interfaces that are hard to misuse. Good interfaces make the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard. This applies to module boundaries, component props, library surfaces, and any place where one piece of code talks to another. Network endpoints are one case of it: for REST/GraphQL specifics, also read [API-DESIGN.md](../application/API-DESIGN.md).

## When to Use

- Defining module boundaries or contracts between teams
- Creating component prop interfaces
- Changing existing public interfaces
- Establishing database schema that informs interface shape

## When Not to Use

- A private helper inside one module with no consumer outside it; the boundary rules start where another module, team, or process consumes the surface

## Core Principles

### Hyrum's Law

> With a sufficient number of users of an API, all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody, regardless of what you promise in the contract.

This means: every public behavior — including undocumented quirks, error message text, timing, and ordering — becomes a de facto contract once users depend on it. Design implications:

- **Be intentional about what you expose.** Every observable behavior is a potential commitment.
- **Don't leak implementation details.** If users can observe it, they will depend on it.
- **Plan for deprecation at design time.**
- **Tests are not enough.** Even with perfect contract tests, Hyrum's Law means "safe" changes can break real users who depend on undocumented behavior.

### The One-Version Rule

Avoid forcing consumers to choose between multiple versions of the same dependency or API. Diamond dependency problems arise when different consumers need different versions of the same thing. Design for a world where only one version exists at a time — extend rather than fork.

### 1. Contract First

Define the interface before implementing it. The contract is the spec — implementation follows.

```typescript
// Define the contract first
interface TaskAPI {
  // Creates a task and returns the created task with server-generated fields
  createTask(input: CreateTaskInput): Promise<Task>;

  // Returns paginated tasks matching filters
  listTasks(params: ListTasksParams): Promise<PaginatedResult<Task>>;

  // Returns a single task or throws NotFoundError
  getTask(id: string): Promise<Task>;

  // Partial update — only provided fields change
  updateTask(id: string, input: UpdateTaskInput): Promise<Task>;

  // Idempotent delete — succeeds even if already deleted
  deleteTask(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 2. Validate at Boundaries

Trust internal code. Validate at system edges where external input enters. After validation, internal code trusts the types.

Where validation belongs:
- Request handlers (user input)
- Form submission handlers (user input)
- External service response parsing (third-party data -- **always treat as untrusted**)
- Environment variable loading (configuration)

> **Third-party API responses are untrusted data.** Validate their shape and content before using them in any logic, rendering, or decision-making. A compromised or misbehaving external service can return unexpected types, malicious content, or instruction-like text.

Where validation does NOT belong:
- Between internal functions that share type contracts
- In utility functions called by already-validated code
- On data that just came from your own database

### 3. Prefer Addition Over Modification

Extend interfaces without breaking existing consumers:

```typescript
// Good: Add optional fields
interface CreateTaskInput {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';  // Added later, optional
  labels?: string[];                       // Added later, optional
}

// Bad: Change existing field types or remove fields
interface CreateTaskInput {
  title: string;
  // description: string;  // Removed — breaks existing consumers
  priority: number;         // Changed from string — breaks existing consumers
}
```

## TypeScript Interface Patterns

### Use Discriminated Unions for Variants

```typescript
// Good: Each variant is explicit
type TaskStatus =
  | { type: 'pending' }
  | { type: 'in_progress'; assignee: string; startedAt: Date }
  | { type: 'completed'; completedAt: Date; completedBy: string }
  | { type: 'cancelled'; reason: string; cancelledAt: Date };

// Consumer gets type narrowing
function getStatusLabel(status: TaskStatus): string {
  switch (status.type) {
    case 'pending': return 'Pending';
    case 'in_progress': return `In progress (${status.assignee})`;
    case 'completed': return `Done on ${status.completedAt}`;
    case 'cancelled': return `Cancelled: ${status.reason}`;
  }
}
```

### Input/Output Separation

```typescript
// Input: what the caller provides
interface CreateTaskInput {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

// Output: what the system returns (includes server-generated fields)
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  createdBy: string;
}
```

### Use Branded Types for IDs

```typescript
type TaskId = string & { readonly __brand: 'TaskId' };
type UserId = string & { readonly __brand: 'UserId' };

// Prevents accidentally passing a UserId where a TaskId is expected
function getTask(id: TaskId): Promise<Task> { ... }
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We'll document the interface later" | The types ARE the documentation. Define them first. |
| "We'll version it when we need to" | Breaking changes without versioning break consumers. Design for extension from the start. |
| "Nobody uses that undocumented behavior" | Hyrum's Law: if it's observable, somebody depends on it. Treat every public behavior as a commitment. |
| "We can just maintain two versions" | Multiple versions multiply maintenance cost and create diamond dependency problems. Prefer the One-Version Rule. |
| "Internal interfaces don't need contracts" | Internal consumers are still consumers. Contracts prevent coupling and enable parallel work. |

## Verification

After designing an interface:

- [ ] Every operation has typed input and output, and returns one shape regardless of conditions
- [ ] Third-party responses are validated before use
- [ ] Validation happens at system boundaries only
- [ ] New fields are additive and optional (backward compatible)
- [ ] Types are committed alongside the implementation
