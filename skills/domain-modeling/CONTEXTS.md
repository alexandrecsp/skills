# Multiple contexts

A root `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` marks a repo with multiple contexts. The map points to where each one lives:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
├── src/
│   ├── ordering/
│   │   ├── GLOSSARY.md
│   │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
│   └── billing/
│       ├── GLOSSARY.md
│       └── docs/adr/
```

Infer which context the current topic belongs to; if unclear, ask. A decision that binds one context goes in that context's `docs/adr/`; one that spans contexts goes in the root `docs/adr/`.

## GLOSSARY-MAP.md

The map lists the contexts, where they live, and how they relate to each other:

```md
# Glossary Map

## Contexts

- [Ordering](./src/ordering/GLOSSARY.md): receives and tracks customer orders
- [Billing](./src/billing/GLOSSARY.md): generates invoices and processes payments
- [Fulfillment](./src/fulfillment/GLOSSARY.md): manages warehouse picking and shipping

## Relationships

- **Ordering → Fulfillment**: Ordering emits `OrderPlaced` events; Fulfillment consumes them to start picking
- **Fulfillment → Billing**: Fulfillment emits `ShipmentDispatched` events; Billing consumes them to generate invoices
- **Ordering ↔ Billing**: Shared types for `CustomerId` and `Money`
```
